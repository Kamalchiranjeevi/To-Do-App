# To-Do-App
HTML is employed to create the layout of the app, including elements such as task lists, input fields, buttons, and checkboxes. CSS is utilized to enhance the visual appeal of the app, providing styling for elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in the functionality of the app, allowing users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed dynamically. Event listeners are implemented to respond to user interactions, such as clicking buttons or checkboxes, and update the app's state accordingly. Additionally, local storage is utilized to persist tasks across sessions, ensuring that users can access their task lists even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

Overall, the "To-Do List App" project demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and feature-rich web application for efficient taskÂ management.
